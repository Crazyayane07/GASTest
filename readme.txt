- Used assets from https://game-icons.net
- UE 5.4
- Used Template from Epic 'First Person Template,' which generated basic C++ files with project prefix 'GASTest.' Normally, I prefer to use separate public/private folders and a shorter prefix like 'GT,' but I wanted to stay consistent with the generated project.
- It was my first time using GAS. Feedback is super welcome!
- I'm not happy with:
	- Not implementing min/max values in C++ and needing to have a separate attribute for MaxHealth and checking if Health is below 0.
	- Having notifications for dummy/player death in blueprint ticks or damage.
	- Not having a better notification when fire dot finishes except in Cue.
	- Implementing bullet and fire damage differently due to inexperience with GAS.
	- More similiar names for ArmorMultiplayer and FireResistance. The higher their value then less damage their actors take.
- ArmorMultiplier only works for dummies. Player always gets constant damage from tiles.
- On the map, there are 3 dummies:
	- Default/Blue: 100 HP, 1x ArmorMultiplier, 1x FireResistance
	- Strong/Red: 150 HP, 2x ArmorMultiplier, 0.5x FireResistance
	- Weak/Yellow: 80 HP, 0.5x ArmorMultiplier, 2x FireResistance
- Bullet Damage: 20
- Fire Damage: 50 + DOT (damage over time)
- Player can change bullet types with numpad keys
- Execution of project took 2 days. Started 12.07.2024 with research about GAS and finished at 13.07.2024
